      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>This individual project was done for CS 3110: Data Structures and Functional Programming.
      Given a document detailing the syntax and semantics of a language called RML, which is essentially a baby version of OCaml, I was tasked with writing the interpreter for the language. I learned how to read a formal semantics document and understand the concepts of big step semantics, stores, configurations, etc. </p>

      <p>I found this project highly rewarding and interesting. It got me interested in the area of programming languages. As someone still figuring out what areas of Computer Science I wanted to focus on, this project was in a way, a catalyst. The following semester, I subsequently enrolled in CS 4110: Programming Languages and Logics and began research in the field.

      <p>Project duration: November 2023 â€“ December 2023</p>
