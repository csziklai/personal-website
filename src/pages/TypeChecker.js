      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>As part of a project for CS 3410: Computer System Organization, I built
         a single-cycle RISC-V processor in Logism. After learning about RISC-V 
         in class, I was tasked with figuring out how to build it myself, including 
         devising the control flow and logic. The project necessitated independent 
         problem-solving and self-directed learning, making it overwhelming at 
         first. Though once all the parts came together, it was a rewarding 
         experience. This class piqued my interest in the domain of computer 
         systems and low-level programming. </p>

      <p>Project duration: February 2024 â€“ March 2024</p>
